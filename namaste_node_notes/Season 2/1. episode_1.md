Intro to project and Microservices vs Monolith - How to build a project

Intro to project (ep 0)

1. Objective - Build 'Dev Tinder' - a Tinder for developers.
2. We'll be creating profiles, sending out requests to other developers
3. Build authentication for logging into the app

How can i make the best out of the Namaste Node
1. Write code, everyday!
2. Build small features, explore and enhance your code and your knowledge in Node JS
3. Tech stack
    1. DB -> mongo db
    2. express js framework
    3. choose your front end (Angular I guess)

Microservices vs Monolith - How to build a project

1. Waterfall Model (SDLC)
    1. Requirement - Project Manager / BA + Designers - PM/BA will procure the requirements and define the product in terms of business logic, Designer will design the mockup and communicate with the PM,
    2. Design - Senior DEV Lead will decide the tech stack, DB diagram, app architecture, deciding to buil a monolith / microservices
    3. Development - Actual DEV will start with in this process
    4. Testing - QA will test the app
    5. Depolyment  - DevOps team will take care of deployment/ managing servers
    6. Maintenance - Following Step 1 - 5, in case a new feature to be added, etc.

==========================================================================================

Monolith Architecture
    1. It's a like one single project, it consists front-end, back-end, DB connection, authethicate code, mail server etc
    Features



Microservice Architecture
    1. Multiple small services, a microservice only for front-end / back-end / auth / notification / analytics and commnicating with each other

Comparison chart

Feature          Monolith        Microservices
===============================================
Dev Speed        Slow            Fast
Code Repo        Large           Small
Scalibility      Tedious         Easy
Deployment       Single          Multiple Deployments required for each microservice
Tech Stack       Restricted      We can use various tech stack for different microservice
Infra Cost       Lower           Higher
Complexity       High            Low
Fault Isolation  High            Low
Testing          Easy(end 2 end) Complex (individual test cases to be added to it)
Ownership        Complex         Easy
Mainteanance     Complex         Easy
Rewamps          Complex         Easy
Debugging        Slightly Easy   Complex
Dev Experience   L               W


==========================================================================================
What are we going to build in Dev Tinder
2 Microservices
1. Front End - Angular (later React JS maybe)
2. Back End - Node JS

Communication b/w Front End and Back End - using API
FE => <= API => <= BE
