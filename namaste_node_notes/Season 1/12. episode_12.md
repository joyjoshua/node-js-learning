Episode 12
Databases - SQL & NoSQL

1. DB is a organized collection of data based on the use of DBMS(datavase managment system)
2. DBMS - is a sw that interacts with end users, applications and the DB itself to capture and analyse the data.
3. Types of DB
    a. Relational DB - MySQL, PostgresSQL
    b. No SQL DB - Mongo DB
    c. In memory DB - Redis (basically used for caching)
    d. Distributed SQL DB - Cockroach DB
    e. Time series DB - Influx DB
    f. OO DB - db4o
    g. Graph DB - Neo4j
    h. Hierarchial DB - IBM IMS (Information Management System)
    i. Network DB - IOMS
    j. Cloud DB - Amazon RDS
4. Selecting the DB depends on the use case of the application that we're building.

RDBMS (MySQL, PostgresSQL)
1. Introduced at 1970s, 1980s 
2. Math scientist "EF Codd" introduced "Codd's 12 Rules" [0-12] - 13 rules
    a. If your DB follows the 13 rules of Codd's it'll be a RDB(Relational DB)
3. 1980s - RDBMS was super popular and largely used
4. Most famous RDBMS - MySQL, PostgresSQL

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MySQL
1. MySQL was invented by Michael Widenius
2. Story about MySQL
    1. Michael has three daughters -> My, Max and Maria
    2. Michael named MySQL after his firstborn - My so MySQL
    3. Michael invented MaxDB, named after his secondborn
    4. Michael created MariaDB, names after his lastborn,
        i. MariaDB is a fork of MySQL
3. MySQL was acquired by Sun Microsystems, and then Oracle acquired it from Sun Microsystems
4. Now, MySQL is maintained by Oracle

PostgresSQL
1. Michael Stonebreaker was working on a project - Ingres (project was part of University of California)
2. Michael later started working on PostIngres later turned into PostgreSQL

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL (Structured Query Language)
1. Query language used to communicate with the DB

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NoSQL aka Not only SQL (MongoDB)
1. Types
    a. Document DB
    b. Key value DB
    c. Graph DB
    d. Wide column DB
    e. Multimodel DB
2. Found in late 2000's

Mongo DB
1. at 2009, MongoDB was developed by 10gen
2. Mongo came from 'Humoungous'
3. later 10gen changed it's name to Mongo DB Inc
4. Developer friendly, flexible and super compatible with node js
5. Stores data in JSON
6. Increases DEV productivity
7. Built by C++, lil bit of JS and python 

Lingo
1. Tables are called 'collection' in MongoDB
2. An entry in a collection is called a 'document'
3. Within a document, each entry (key value pair) is called a 'fields

Example

//below is a collection under the collection we have one document

{                                         // called as a document
    "_id:: 1,                             //called as a field
    "first_name": "Leslie",               //called as a field
    "last_name": 'Yepp,                   //called as a field
    "cell": "432342323",                  //called as a field
    "hobbies": ["coding", "working out"]; //called as a field
}

Pros
1. No need for joins
2. No need for data normalization


Difference bw RDBMS and NoSQL

RDBMS
1. Table, Rows and Columns
2. Structured Data
3. Fixed Schema (Schema is not but the columns in the table)
4. SQL
5. Tough horizintal scaling
6. Realtionships - keys (primary key, foreign key) and joins
7. Read heavy apps, transaction workloads
8. Ex: Banking apps


NoSQL
1. Collection, documents and fields
2. Unstructured Data
3. Flexible schema
4. Mongo(MQL), Neo4J (Cypher)
5. Easy to scale horizontally
6. Nested Relationships
7. Real time, Big data, distributed computing
8. Ex: Real Time analytics, social media
