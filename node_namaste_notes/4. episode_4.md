Episode 4 - module.exports & require

1. Usually, in an app we create various files and folders to maintain our code/features, we include them files / modules in our main module, for example app.js
2. To import code from other modules, we use require function to get the code from other modules.
    1. require('code path') -> require('./xyz.js');
    2. Modules protects their variables and methods to prevent leaking
3. In order to recieve the variables and methods from a module, the module has to export the said variables and methods, and only then a module requiring another module can recive the variables and methods.
4. For example
    1. In sum.js, calculateSum is method creating to calculate sum of 2 numbers and console log it.
    2. If I want the app.js to use calculateSum from sum.js,
        1. first, the sum.js needs to export the method by
            module.exports - {calculateSum}
        2. And then app.js can import it by using require method
            const {calculateSum} = require('./modules/sum');
    3. Code snippets 
        1. app.js - (code_snippets\app.js)
        2. sum.js - (code_snippets\sum.js)

5. Patterns followed

    1. Common JS Module
        1. Common JS Module (cjs) uses module.exports and require for exporting and importing modules
        2. package.json -> type: 'commonjs'
        3. By default, common module is used in Node JS
        4. Legacy methodology
        5. It's synchronous 
        6. It's run in non-strict mode

    2. ES Modules (ESM) (mjs)
        1. import and export is used for importing and exporting modules
        2. packagae.json -> type: 'module',
        3. By default, used in React, Angular etc
        4. New methodology, as JS committee is suggesting to make this method as standard
        5. Async options are available
        6. It's run in strict mode

6. Patterns for creating / importing / exporting modules
    1. To export a variable(s), method(s) 
        1. We can use module.exports    
            1. Either export in the format of an object (module.exports = {method, variable})
            2. Export the varaible/method directly (module.exports = variable;) 
    2. To import a variables(s), method(s)
        1. We can use 
            1. Directly import using variable/method name
            2. If an module is exporting as an object
                1. Import the module, and access it using the fot operator (module.variable, module.method())
                2. Destrcurte the object
                    const {variable, method} = require('./module)

    3. Creating a module folder to encapsulate all files and importing all methods and variables using a single file
        Use case
        1. In [/code_snippets/modules/calculate/sum.js] we export calculateSum method which calulates the sum of 2 numbers
        2. In [/code_snippets/modules/calculate/multiply.js] we export calculateProduct method which calculates the product of 2 numbers
        3. In [/code_snippets/modules/calculate/index.js] we import those 2 methods and export it
        4. In [/code_snippets/app.js] we import the module folder where it imports all the methods in index.js by default, where we can use those methods to calculate the sum and product
        5. The reason why we do this, is to abstract required methods and variables and ignore other logics in the module files. And as the code base grows larger it'll help us to maintain the code easily.

7. We can import json files by simply using the name
    1. Example - const data = require(/path of the json file)
