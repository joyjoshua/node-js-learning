Namaste Node
Episode 6 - libuv and async IO

1. Javascript
    a. synchronous single threaded language
    b. v8 engine is run on one thread in a synchronous fashion
        i. Line by line code execution
2. Synchronous vs Asynchronous

    SCENARIO: Restuarant Scenario
    1. Let's assume there's a restautant which caters coke, pizza and noodles, where the restaurant take
        a. 0 mins to deliver coke
        b. 10 mins to cook and deliver pizza, and
        c. 5 mins to cook and deliver noodles
    2. A,B,C,D and E are the customers to the restaurant where
        a. A ordered Coke
        b. B ordered Pizza
        c. C ordered Noodles
        d. D ordered Noodles
        e. E ordered Coke
    
    How does Synchronous work on the above scenario
    1. A will recieve immediately as Coke requires 0 mins to deliver
    2. B will have to wait 10 mins to get the pizza delivered
    3. C will have to wait 15 mins to get the noodles delivered (Have to wait after B request is satisfied - +10 mins)
    4. D will have to wait for 20 to get the pizza get delivered (A + B + C (wait time) + D Noodles prep time)
    5. E will have to wait 20 mins to get the Coke delivered! (sed lyf)
    6. Total time to satisfy all request - 20mins

    Result
    1. The queue is getting blocked, where each user has to wait till the previous user gets the request satisfies
    2. User E, who ordered coke will have to wait for 25 mins eventhough the prep time for Coke is just 0 mins, so this sync flow is time consuming and inefficient

    How does Asnychronous work on the above scenario
    In Async let's assume there's a concept of waiting room, where the user can wait once they place the order, and the restautant peeps will contact the user once their order is fullfilled
    1. A will recieve immediately as Coke requires 0 mins to deliver
    2. B will place the order and wait in the waiting room
    3. C will place the order and wait in the waiting room
    4. D will place the order and wait in the waiting room
    5. E will recieve immediately as Coke requires 0 mins to deliver

    Result
    1. B will recieve the Noodles order as it takes 5 mins to prep
    2. B and D will recieve the Pizza and Noodles order as it takes 10mins and (B order time + Noodle prep time (5 + 5 = 10mmins)) at the same time
    3. Total time to satisfy all request - 15 mins
    4. It's efficient in the long run compared to sync


3. Synchronous code execution
    var a = 1000;
    var b = 10;

    function multiplyFn(a, b) {
        const result = a * b;
        return result;
    }

    var c = multiply(a, b);

    Key items in JS code execution
    1. Call Stack - Call Stack is the place where all JS code is executed
    2. Memory Heap - Memory Heap allocates a space for all the variables initialized 
    3. Garbage Collector - GC will be used to collects unused variables / memory and clears them

    JS Code execution process
    1. Whenever code is executed in the call stack, a global execution context is created for all the variables and functions created ie, var a, b and c, multiply()
        a. In the execution of GEC, memory allocation of the variables and functions are done
    2. When a function is called, a function execution context will be created and run in a synchronous manner
    3. When function execution is completed, then the function execution context will be popped of the call stack
    4. Once execution in GEC is completed, the GEC is popped off the call stack, hence the entire JS file is run.

4. Asynchronous  Code Execution by JS Engine
    1. Async execution examples - DB Access, HTTP request, Read Files in local, Time(setTimeout, setImmediaite)
    2. JS Engine cannot handle the execution of Async operations
    3. Node happens to have the superpowers to handle all the Async functions, so Node will be act as a mediator b/w JS Engine and OS, Node will handle the async functions by contacting the OS and request the OS for the action, gets back the response and send the response to JS engine, where it'll be passed to the call stack and execute the response from Node
    4. The "super powers" in Node is called "libuv"
    5. For example, let's assume we need to access file system and request some data in our app, so Node will use libuv to request OS for accessing the file system, get the response and sends the response to v8
    6. Similiar things are done for other async operations such as HTTP request, DB request, timer etc

5. libuv
    1. libuv acts a middleware b/w v8 and OS to especially handle async IO operations
    2. whenever the app gets a async task, Node JS will let libuv handle the async operations by establishing contact will the OS to handle the request gets the response from OS and sends the response to v8
    3. Code explanation

    var a = 10;
    var b = 20;

    http.get("https://api.fbi.com", (res) => {
        console.log('res);
    })

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('setTimeout)
    }, 5000);

    fs.readFile("./gossip.txt", "utf8", (data) => {
        console.log("File Data", data)
    })

    function multiply(x, y) {
        const res = x * y;
        return res;
    }
    
6. Execution of Sync and Async code in Node
    var a = 10;
    var b = 20;

    const https = require('https');

    https.get("https://api.github.com/users/joyjoshua",
        (res) => {
            console.log('http resolved');
    });

    setTimeout(()=> {
        console.log('timer for 1 second completed')
    }, 1000);

    console.log(a, b);

    Execution
    when v8 in node runs the above code, 
    a GEC will be created for the entire code
    1. it identifies var a = 10; var b = 20; gets those 2 variables are allocted to the memory
    2. when v8 identifies https method, it offloads the work to libuv, where the execution of the http will run parallely
    3. v8 will go the next line and identify a timer, again v8 will offload the work to libuv and libuv will take up the work parallely
    4. next line is console.log(a, b);, where the v8 will immediately run and executes the code
    5. Once the http call is resolved and response is given, libuv add the repsone to the callstack, a callback function execution is created and once the execution of the callback is completed the callback FEC is removed from the call stack and if any variables created inside the callback will be cleared from the garbage collector
    6. Then after one second, the timer is complete, and libuv recieves the response / callback from OS, the callback is added to the call stack, and FEC is created for the timer callback, once the callback content is executed (console logging a message), the FEC is removed the call stack
    7. And the main call stack is empty as all operations are completed
    8. Result  
        a. First, console.log(a, b); 10,20 will be printed
        b. HTTP response will be printed
        c. Timer Message will be printed

        //res
        10, 20
        http resolved
        timer for 1 second completed
